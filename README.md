# LLVM Distributor Conference

A day of lightning talks for folks who distribute and release builds of LLVM,
with a focus on configuration, testing, and unique constraints.

If you build LLVM for other users, we want to hear about how you build LLVM,
some of the unique constraints of your users or target environment,
configurations or configuration tips, war stories, headaches, distribution
recommendations, and problems that would be nice to solve.

Some example distributions of LLVM that might be of interest:
* Apple LLVM
* RHEL LLVM
* Snapdragon LLVM
* apt.llvm.org
* AOSP LLVM
* CrOS LLVM
* BSDs
* PlayStation LLVM
* Chromium LLVM
* your distro here

## When

Thursday September 16 2021, times to be determined.

conference. We will add a schedule here with accepted talks.
